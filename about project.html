                             <p>Starting from a scanty pioneering class what is dubbed as the overpopulated “dumping – pit”, Zamboanga del Norte including its twin cities of Dipolog and Dapitan with its numerous enrollees, Zamboanga del Norte National High School’s humble  take – off can be traced back to the early post – war time – 1946.
                             <br>
                             Due to the populaces’ insistent clamor for higher education made intense to shake off war aftermath, which caused them to travel to nearby island provinces of Negros and Cebu, the provincial government of once – unified Zamboanga Peninsula, through ex–Governor Felipe B. Azcuna, authorized the transfer of Zamboanga Provincial High School, then operating in the erstwhile capital town of Zamboanga (now Zamboanga City), to his hometown in up north Dipolog, thus beginning the chain of efforts.
